These are the following two ways, in which we can use camera in our application

    1. Using existing android camera application in our application
    2. Directly using Camera API provided by android in our application

Using existing android camera application in our application:
We will use MediaStore.ACTION_IMAGE_CAPTURE to launch an existing camera application installed on our phone.
